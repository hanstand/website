			<p class="statementText"> I have a great interest in systems, patterns, and logic. I take two distinct approaches to these subjects: mathematics and dance. The former allows me to understand the abstract and theoretical aspects of these interests while the latter provides me with a way to experiment with these concepts visually and physically. 
			<br></br>I find that choreographing dancers is about organizing systems and unearthing patterns. Further, I have discovered that generating movement material can, in some ways, be equated to developing an algorithm. The choreographer provides a structural impetus and the dancers carry out the instructions to reveal a precise output. I tinker with existing mathematical structures to develop movement material and enjoy observing the unexpected yet unbelievably precise patterns that emerge. 
			<br></br>Further, I am interested in the convergence of dance and technology. I am particularly interested in visualizing choreographic structures. What does it mean to quantify a choreographic system? Could we reveal unseen patterns? Manipulate the dance? Re-imagine what else it might look like? What is the relevance of understanding and synthesizing an organic physical system such as dance? Does seeing the data change the way we dance? Does it change the way we perceive dance?
